A collaborative text editor is a web application that allows multiple users to edit a document at the same time. This is accomplished by using websockets to communicate changes made by one user to all other connected users in real-time. The application typically includes a text box where users can enter text, and any changes made by one user are immediately reflected in the text box of all other users. Collaborative text editors are often used for collaborative writing or editing, allowing multiple users to work together on a document in real-time.
